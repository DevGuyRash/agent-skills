# Evaluation Corpus

Each skill's `evals/` directory is the canonical portable trigger and task
fixture. `composition-corpus.json` covers cross-skill precedence and sibling
boundaries that cannot be evaluated from one skill in isolation.

Run these prompts in fresh Codex and Claude tasks after local installation.
Compare routing and observable task quality against a no-plugin baseline and,
for affected Rust/GitOps cases, the prior plugin behavior. Do not score exact
prose or request a private reasoning transcript.

Record host, plugin version, visible skill count, active skills, references
loaded, task result, verification evidence, unsupported mandates, unnecessary
work, and approximate active-context cost. An unavailable runtime is an
unverified result, not a pass or failure.
